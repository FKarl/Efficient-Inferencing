short: "I love machine learning."

# Medium sentence (~25 words)
medium: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This field focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide."

# Long sentence (>200 words)
long: "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming many areas of our lives, from autonomous vehicles and smart home appliances to personalized recommendation systems and customer support chatbots. With advances in computing power, the availability of large datasets, and improvements in algorithms, AI systems are now able to recognize patterns, learn from experience, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. However, while these technologies have enormous potential, they also raise ethical and societal concerns. We can see the impacts of these technologies in job markets where automation has displaced certain roles, leading to concerns about future employment trends. There are also privacy issues related to the vast amounts of data being collected, stored, and processed. Without robust protections in place, there is a risk of misuse of this information. Furthermore, the potential misuse of AI in areas like surveillance and warfare is a pressing concern. As we continue to develop and deploy AI systems, it is crucial that we also have discussions about how to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically. Alongside this, the establishment of regulations to prevent misuse and protect people's rights is of paramount importance. As AI continues to advance, these conversations will become increasingly significant in guiding the safe and beneficial development of these powerful technologies."
